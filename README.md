# PixieReport
Pictorial weather reports inspired by Tamsin Bowles' Weatherpixie site.

For background, history, and context see the [Weatherpixie Prospectus](doc/weatherpixie-prospectus.md).

Demo:

* `npm start` will launch a server on localhost:3000 which will compose a sample pixie in html+png format.
* `npm run static` will launch a server on localhost:8000 pointing to index.html which uses the browser runtime to compose a pixie.
